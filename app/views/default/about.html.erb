<p>The Partnership for Health had its beginnings in October 1996Â when a small group of local business and health care leaders met to discuss organizing a local partnership that would address the changing health care needs of Lowndes County. As a result, this group developed into a non-profit corporation originally named the Lowndes County Partnership for Health, which was changed to the South Georgia Partnership for Health in 2014 due to expanding nature of its program service area to surrounding counties.</p>

<p>Since its inception the Partnership for Health has sought to create community partnerships that address the health care needs of Lowndes County and the surrounding area. The Partnership for Health operates five programs: the Partnership Health Center, a free primary care clinic for the working uninsured residents of Lowndes County; the Partnership Cancer Fund, which raises funds for local cancer patients; the Partnership for Healthy Living, which conducts physical activity and nutrition programs; Medbank, a Pharmacy Assistance Program; and a wellness and disease management program for 
self insured employers.</p>

<p>Program Partners include: South Georgia Medical Center, Valdosta State University, Wiregrass Georgia Technical College, Moody Air Force Base, the City of Valdosta, Lowndes County Commissioners, Lowndes County School System, City of Valdosta School System, Public Health, Azalea Health Innovations, Georgia Charitable Care Network, the Healthcare Georgia Foundation, local healthcare providers, local industry, various local agencies, and individuals.</p>
